Analytical Applied Project on The Impact of Student-Faculty Interaction on Students’ Retention in Undergraduate Communities
Abstract
Institution everywhere faces numerous challenges. One of the major challenges is that it is becoming hard for educational institutions to retain students. Most of the institutions are creating a supportive environment just right for the student to progress in their academic and feel safe and energetic about learning. Institutions would have a successful student retention rate if they use a direct student-focused approach and are ready to invest in resources to do so. The study for my research relate exclusively with student retention and try to understand the importance of student engagement to student learning. How does interaction with the instructor outside of class impact the students’ ability to reflect and integrate ideas, challenge innovative ideas, and combine diverse ideas into to conceptual frameworks, that helps in increasing the retention? The samples were collected through course evaluation survey and National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) of 2013, 2015 and 2017 data from Harrisburg University.
